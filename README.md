## Meet Dysperse.

Dysperse is an app that helps users increase their productivity and organization by providing a free and open-source platform that allows people to organize their homes, belongings, tasks, checklists, and goals. The app has a user-friendly interface and customizable boards and checklists. It also has robust analytics and reporting, as well as gamification elements like achievements and rewards to motivate users. Dysperse is built with technologies such as TypeScript/JavaScript, React, React Native, and Electron, and also offers integration with popular virtual assistants. It is accessible for everyone and available on any device.

## Why?

Dysperse offers several unique features and benefits that may make it a more appealing option for users compared to other productivity apps. Some of these include:

- Free and open-source: Dysperse is completely free to use and the source code is available for anyone to review, modify, and contribute to. This makes it accessible to a wide range of users and allows for a strong community of developers to continue improving the app.

- Customizable boards and checklists: Dysperse allows users to create boards and checklists that fit their specific needs and preferences. This allows for a more personalized and effective experience.

- Gamification elements: Dysperse includes features such as achievements, trophies, and rewards to motivate and engage users. This can make the app more fun and enjoyable to use, encouraging users to keep coming back.

- Scan feature: Dysperse helps people quickly add items to their inventory by simply hovering their camera over an item, and using AI to recognize the item, which eliminates the need for typing and manual data entry.

- Collaboration: Dysperse allows users to share their boards, checklists, inventory, and goals with family and friends, which can be helpful for people living in a dorm or shared house to stay organized.

- Zero competition with other home inventory apps: Most existing solutions for home inventory apps have terrible reviews. Dysperse is one of the first apps that focus on home inventory, so it could be a solution for the people looking for a home inventory app

- User-friendly interface: Dysperse has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and understand how to use the app.

These features and benefits, along with the app's mission to empower people to take control of their productivity and organization, may make it a more appealing option for users compared to other productivity apps.

### A bit about us

As the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I started to face new challenges in terms of productivity and organization. With me working from home, the lines between personal and professional lives became blurred, and I felt the need for a tool to help me manage my tasks and responsibilities. Additionally, the pandemic created a sense of uncertainty and anxiety, which made it more difficult to focus and stay motivated. I saw this as an opportunity and decided to start working on an app that addresses these issues and empowers people to take control of their productivity and organization in the face of such adversity. That's how the idea of Dysperse came to life.

### By students, for students & families
