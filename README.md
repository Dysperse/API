### Meet Smartlist.
Smartlist is a free home inventory app that lets you keep track of what you have in your home, and helps you save money.

### Why?
Tracking what you have in your home can be painful, and Smartlist makes it easier. Smartlist helps you control how much you spend, set financial goals, and more

#### A bit about us
Smartlist started in 2020, around the peak COVID-19 crisis. Smartlist is **non-commercial**, **open-source**, and **free, forever**!

### By students, for students & families
Hey! I'm Manu. I started Smartlist as a middle school project. I often found my parents struggling with home inventory, shopping lists, and more. That's why I wanted to build Smartlist: home inventory, lists, and finances, for free!
