DESCRIPTION:Welcome to Honors Modern World History!  :)  This will be you
 r first time submitting a proper Canvas assignment\, so use it to get used
  to the system!  Please use the following prompts to help guide you as yo
 u write your letter:\n\n* Introduce yourself!  Tell me anything about you
 rself that you think is important for me to know\, or you would just like 
 me to know.  You can tell me about how much you love dogs\, how excited y
 ou are for the year\, or about anything you have going on at home.  \n\n
 * What sort of things come easy for you?  What things are challenging?  
 What do you think you might need help with?  (Example:  I struggle with 
 writing essays and would really love support in that area\, or\, I learn b
 est through visuals.) \n\n* What kind of learner are you?  Do you need l
 ots of opportunities to work with and collaborate with others\, or do you 
 prefer to fly solo?\n\n* What questions/concerns do you have about taking 
 this course?\n\n* What are the qualities you like to see in a teacher?\n\n
 * Include a photo of yourself - this helps Ms. Smiley get to know all of y
 ou better!\n\nYou do not have to answer ALL of these questions!  Remember
 \, they are only a guide\, and this is just supposed to be an introductory
  letter so I can get to know you.  If you are taking more than 15 minutes
  to write it\, it may be getting too long!  :)
